Installation
============
To install the latest stable version of :code:`fafbseg-py` with :code:`pip`.

.. code-block:: bat

   pip3 install fafbseg

For the development version from Github:

.. code-block:: bat

   pip3 install git+git://github.com/navis-org/fafbseg-py.git


Now have a look at the :ref:`examples<tutorials>` or the :ref:`API<api>`
to get started.

.. warning::

  ``fafbseg`` has not been tested on Windows and is unlikely to work off the
  bat. I highly recommend using either OSX or Linux.

Installation
============
To install the latest stable version of :code:`fafbseg-py` with :code:`pip`.

.. code-block:: bat

   pip3 install fafbseg

For the development version from Github:

.. code-block:: bat

   pip3 install git+https://github.com/navis-org/fafbseg-py.git


Now have a look at the :ref:`examples<tutorials>` or the :ref:`API<api>`
to get started.

.. warning::

  For Windows users: ``fafbseg`` is unlikely to work off the bat even if you use
  ``conda``. I highly recommend you install and use
  `Windows Subsystem for Linux <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install>`_.
